    "# Task 4: Build and evaluate Q&A Application using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using RAG Assessment (RAGAS) framework\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you build and evaluate a Q&A application using LangChain's *AmazonKnowledgeBasesRetriever* class, Chains, and the RAGAS framework for evaluating the responses. Here, you query the knowledge base to get the desired number of document chunks based on similarity search. Next, you prompt the text generation LLM by supplying the document chunks as context along with the query. Then you evaluate the responses using the following evaluation metrics: faithfulness, answer_relevancy, context_recall, context_precision, context_entity_recall, answer_similarity, answer_correctness, harmfulness, maliciousness, coherence, correctness and conciseness.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"fas fa-info-circle\" style=\"color:#007FAA\"></i> **Learn more:** Refer to *[Metrics](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html)* for additional information about different metrics used with the Ragas framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "You implement the solution using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. RAG retrieves data from outside the language model and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. In this task, you create responses to queries using the knowledge base that was already created during lab provisioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- You utilize RAGAS for evaluation on the following metrics:\n",
    "  - **Faithfulness:** This measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context. It is calculated from answer and retrieved context. The answer is scaled to (0,1) range. Higher the better.\n",
    "  - **Answer Relevance:** This metric focuses on assessing how pertinent the generated answer is to the given prompt. A lower score is assigned to answers that are incomplete or contain redundant information and higher scores indicate better relevancy. This metric is computed using the question, the context and the answer. Please note, that even though in practice the score will range between 0 and 1 most of the time, this is not mathematically guaranteed, due to the nature of the cosine similarity ranging from -1 to 1.\n",
    "  - **Context Precision:** This is a metric that evaluates whether all of the ground-truth relevant items present in the contexts are ranked higher or not. Ideally all the relevant chunks must appear at the top ranks. This metric is computed using the question, ground_truth and the contexts, with values ranging between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better precision.\n",
    "  - **Context Recall:** This metric measures the extent to which the retrieved context aligns with the annotated answer, treated as the ground truth. It is computed based on the ground truth and the retrieved context, and the values range between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating better performance.\n",
    "  - **Context entities recall:** This metric gives the measure of recall of the retrieved context, based on the number of entities present in both ground_truths and contexts relative to the number of entities present in the ground_truths alone. Simply put, it is a measure of what fraction of entities are recalled from ground_truths. This metric is useful in fact-based use cases like tourism help desk, historical QA, etc. This metric can help evaluate the retrieval mechanism for entities, based on comparison with entities present in ground_truths, because in cases where entities matter, we need the contexts which cover them.\n",
    "  - **Answer Semantic Similarity:** The concept of Answer Semantic Similarity pertains to the assessment of the semantic resemblance between the generated answer and the ground truth. This evaluation is based on the ground truth and the answer, with values falling within the range of 0 to 1. A higher score signifies a better alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth.\n",
    "  - **Answer Correctness:** The assessment of Answer Correctness involves gauging the accuracy of the generated answer when compared to the ground truth. This evaluation relies on the ground truth and the answer, with scores ranging from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates a closer alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth, signifying better correctness. Answer correctness encompasses two critical aspects: semantic similarity between the generated answer and the ground truth, as well as factual similarity. These aspects are combined using a weighted scheme to formulate the answer correctness score. Users also have the option to employ a ‘threshold’ value to round the resulting score to binary, if desired.\n",
    "  - **Aspect Critique:** This is designed to assess submissions based on predefined aspects such as harmlessness and correctness. The output of aspect critiques is binary, indicating whether the submission aligns with the defined aspect or not. This evaluation is performed using the ‘answer’ as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you use AnyCompany's financial 10k reports (synthetically generated dataset) as a text corpus to perform Q&A on. This data is already ingested into the Knowledge Base in Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"fas fa-sticky-note\" style=\"color:#563377\"></i> **Note:** In your specific use case, you can sync different files for different domain topics and query this notebook in the same manner to evaluate model responses using the retrieve API from knowledge bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"fas fa-exclamation-circle\" style=\"color:#7C5AED\"></i> **Caution:** It is recommended to run each code cell individually rather than using the **Run All Cells** option from the **Run** menu. Running all cells together can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, such as the Kernel crashing or restarting. By executing cells one by one, you can better control the execution flow, catch potential errors early, and ensure that your code runs as intended."

The company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and are audited by an independent accounting firm. The financial statements provide detailed information about the company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The company's revenue increased by 10% to $1.2 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, and the company's net income and earnings per share both increased compared to 2020. However, the company also saw an increase in costs, including raw material costs, labor costs, marketing and advertising expenses, and research and development costs. Despite these increases, AnyCompany Financial was able to maintain its gross margin and operating margin. The company's concentration of credit risk is relatively low compared to industry peers, and it is committed to providing transparent and comprehensive disclosures about market risk, both quantitative and qualitative. Based on this information, it can be inferred that AnyCompany Financial is a financially stable and growing company with a strong focus on risk management and transparency.\n",
