    "\n",
    "In this task, you build a Q&A application using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases with *Retrieve* API. Here, you query the knowledge base to get the desired number of document chunks based on similarity search. You then augment the prompt with relevant documents and perform a query which acts as input to Anthropic Claude for generating response.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a knowledge base, you can securely connect foundation models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock to your company's data for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Access to additional data helps the model generate more relevant, context-specific and accurate responses without continuously retraining the FM. All information retrieved from knowledge bases comes with source attribution to improve transparency and minimize hallucinations.\n",
