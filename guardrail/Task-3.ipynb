    "\n",
    "In this task you understand and test the Query Reformulation process supported by Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. With query reformulation, you take a complex input prompt and break it down into multiple sub-queries. These sub-queries separately go through their own retrieval steps for relevant chunks. The resulting chunks are then pooled and ranked together before passing them to the Foundational Model to generate a response. Query reformulation is another tool that helps in increasing the accuracy for complex queries that your application may face in production.\n",
